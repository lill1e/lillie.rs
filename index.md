## About Me
This field has been something that I have been involved in for most of my life at this point, essentially producing such a degree of drive I have for writing code. As of now, most of my interests include writing various QoL software. However because of the doors my education has opened for me, I have gathered interest to lower level systems development and especially the development/design of programming languages. As I learned, I found that teaching people was something I gained a lot of enjoyment through, up until now I have held two different Teaching Assistant positions and have worked as such for two  consecutive semesters. On top of that, I also spend my time tutoring for my university's Computer Science department. As for my own self enjoyment, I have taken a huge interest in recent times regarding Grand Theft Auto: V development/modding, feel free to take a look at those respective projects or any others!
